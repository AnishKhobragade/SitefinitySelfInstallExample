This project allows you to create self-installing widgets and modules for Sitefinity.

This way, you can simplify any deployment or installation scenario by allowing installation tasks to happen by merely pasting .dll files into the bin folder of any Sitefinity application and that would be it! Simple, fast and beautiful.

Installation instructions:

1.	Add the project to a solution in which you have Sitefinity Web Application project

2.	In the SitefinitySelfInstallExample project, make sure to point to the Telerik.OpenAccess, Telerik.Sitefinity and Telerik.Sitefinity.Model assemblies located in the bin folder of your Sitefinity Web Application project (SitefinityWebApp)

3.	Create a reference from your SitefinityWebApp to point to the SitefinitySelfInstallExample project

4.	Build the solution and you should be good to go.
